#Phase1-week1-code-challenge

##Project Goal

 -There are three challenges in this project.We are going to write a code in each challenge to help obtain the required result.
 
 
 -Create a repository on your GitHub account.
 
 
 -Use Javascript to wire down the solution.
 
 
 -Push the solution to the above repository once done.
 -Ensure your repository has a well written README.
 
##Installation

After creating the repo on github,you need to clone it in your machine so as to use it by following the steps below: 
 -Open a terminal on your computer.
 -Clone the repo by using the following;
      git clone git@github.com:Issa92optimus/phase1-week1-code-challenge.git
 -After it creates a copy on your local machine,change directory to the repo folder by using;
      cd Phase1-week1-code-challenge
 -Open it in Visual Studio Code by using command;
      code .
      
 NOTE:You will now be able to see some inner folders of the code challenge i.e challenge1,challenge2 and challenge-3

###Challenge1(Student Grade Generator)
        
###Read the test

Write that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 
A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

##Running the application
 -To run the app you use the following steps
   a.)Install the required dependancy from npm
        npm install
   b.)Run the application from the browser
        npm start
        
NOTE: Open up your browser and by clicking the check button tou will be able to analify the test.


##Challenge2(Speed Detector)

##Read the test

Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

##Challenge3(Net Salary Calculator)

##Read the test
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 
NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
